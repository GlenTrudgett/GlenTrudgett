# About Me

I'm interested in making IT Operational Management processes and procedures into useful and consistent automation.
Each consistent automation builds on the last. At least that is the ideal I work towards.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning better software development workflows to make life easier for me and my team.

- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - Providing Forms for your team, prompts the user for the necessary information required.
  - Formatting output in a consistent manner provides:
    - Clear and Consistent Communication
    - Automation opportunities in reporting and alerting.
    - Lowers the cognitive load
  - The simplest automation steps create a "time gap", which can leverage the creation of further automation. It's cyclical!
  - Less in the majority of cases, is more!
